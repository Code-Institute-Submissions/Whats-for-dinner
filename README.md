Have you ever been in a position that its time to go eat but you have no idea what to eat? well think no more and let the website choice a dish for you. If you want the website can find a restaurant near your current location aswell!

UX
This site is pretty straight forward, this site helps you to choice what your gonna eat for any user anywhere who has acces to the internet and money to buy food.

- Usertype 1 :  Wants to decide what he is gonna eat for dinner. After the user selects some buttons he can click the submit button until satisfied with his dish
- Usertype 2 : This user wants to decide what to eat and where to eat. So he presses the buttons to decide what to eat, and if he scrolls down a bit or clicks on the navbar "where am I gonna eat" he should see a nearly full screen maps with all the restaurants marked for the current Dish

Testing

Code testing
I fixed mulitple missing ) and ; right away 
I used Console.log command and debugger for multiple things:
 - to check if my buttons extended myObj properly
 - to check if my randomdish is a random dish of myObj
- to check what my results from google maps where when I searched for restaurants
I checked no buttons and see if the code says you need to check a button.
